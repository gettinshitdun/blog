## About 

We are a couple of college friends now fresh into the CS industry. This blog is a platform for us to share our experiences, opinions and learnings with the rest of the world while also making a place to find it when needed.
While all of us belong to a engineering background, the content found on this blog will not be limited to just that, however do not be surprised if it is dominant!
